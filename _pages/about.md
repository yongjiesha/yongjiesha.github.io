I am a PhD student with research interests in community health informatics, human-computer interaction, and computer-supported cooperative work. My advisors are Tiffany Veinot and Sun Young Park. I have been working on identifying how technology, especially AI/LLM-enabled applications, can support social needs assessment and referral processes in the safety net and human service settings in Michigan. Previously, I have written and researched in the space of substance use and HIV prevention, including applying feminist theories to design a mobile app for overdose reversals in Philadelphia and community-based participatory research to improve HIV preventive outcomes among LGBTQ communities in China.

I currently identify with a rather fuzzy epistemology, meaning I enjoy both evidence-based and interpretivist approaches to research. I believe that decentralized and participatory methods of health technology design can foster a more democratic health ecosystem and contribute to a more equitable health future for all.
