Background

Adherent pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake can prevent HIV infections. Despite the high HIV incidence, Chinese key populations have low PrEP uptake and adherence. New interventions are needed to increase PrEP adherence among key populations in China. Co-creation methods are helpful to solicit ideas from the community to solve public health problems. The study protocol aims to describe the design of a stepped-wedge trial and to evaluate the efficacy of co-created interventions to facilitate PrEP adherence among key populations in China.

Methods

The study will develop intervention packages to facilitate PrEP adherence among Chinese key populations using co-creation methods. The study will then evaluate the efficacy of the co-created intervention packages using a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial. This four-phased closed cohort stepped-wedge design will have four clusters. Each cluster will start intervention at three-month intervals. Seven hundred participants who initiated PrEP will be recruited. Participants will be randomized to the clusters using block randomization. The intervention condition includes receiving co-created interventions in addition to standard of care. The control condition is the standard of care that includes routine clinical assessment every 3 months. All participants will also receive an online follow-up survey every 3 months to record medication adherence and will be encouraged to use a WeChat mini-app for sexual and mental health education throughout the study. The primary outcomes are PrEP adherence and retention in PrEP care throughout the study period. We will examine a hypothesis that a co-created intervention can facilitate PrEP adherence. Generalized linear mixed models will be used for the primary outcome analysis.

Discussion

Developing PrEP adherence interventions in China faces barriers including suboptimal PrEP uptake among key populations, the lack of effective PrEP service delivery models, and insufficient community engagement in PrEP initiatives. Our study design addresses these obstacles by using co-creation to generate social media-based intervention materials and embedding the study design in the local healthcare system. The study outcomes may have implications for policy and intervention practices among CBOs and the medical system to facilitate PrEP adherence among key populations.
