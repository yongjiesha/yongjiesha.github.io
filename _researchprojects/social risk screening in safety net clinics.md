This study aims to conduct in-depth interviews with community health workers and staff members at community-based organizations to understand their experiences and challenges in collecting social determinants of health information and referring individuals to social services. The interview will also ask questions about your perceptions and attitudes toward AI.

I am actively recruiting participants for an online 60-90 minute interview.
