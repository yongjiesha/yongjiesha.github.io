This study aims to conduct in-depth interviews with patients, providers, and clinical social workers or staff members in safety net clinics to understand their needs and challenges in reporting, collecting, and using social determinants of health data in clinical settings. I am actively recruiting patients and clinicians for an online 60-90 mins interview.

Interested? Send me an email or fill out the following survey to let me know!
