There is a growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to healthcare. However, in a world where health inequities and discrimination exist, a number of factors can generate or perpetuate inequalities as a result of implementing AI systems in healthcare. For example, who has access to AI-powered healthcare, what health issues and populations are given priority, and who guides AI developments all play a role in determining which health concerns are highlighted and addressed as the influence of AI in healthcare grows.

This study aims to conduct in-depth interviews with clinicians in safety net clinics in the state of Michigan to understand their needs and challenges in collecting and using social determinants of health data. The interview will also ask questions about your perceptions and attitudes toward AI. The results of the study will help inform the design of an AI system that serves the needs of safety net clinics. 

I am actively recruiting clinicians for an online 60-90 minute interview.

Interested? Send me an email or fill out the following survey to let me know!
