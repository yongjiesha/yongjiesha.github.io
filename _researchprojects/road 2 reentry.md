The project is a 2-year community-based study with a goal to use data to understand the reentry-related information needs and practices of formerly incarcerated people, and how various factors shape their access to critical reentry services such as healthcare and technology literacy and engagement with institutions during the reintegration process. The overall goal will be to develop a state-wide reentry planning guide for formerly incarcerated people living in the state of Michigan.
